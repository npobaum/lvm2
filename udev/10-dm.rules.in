# Udev rules for device-mapper devices.
#
# These rules create a DM control node in /dev/(DM_DIR) directory.
# The rules also create nodes named dm-x (x is a number) in /dev
# directory and symlinks to these nodes with names given by
# the actual DM names. Some udev environment variables are set
# for use in later rules:
#   DM_NAME - actual DM device's name
#   DM_UUID - UUID set for DM device (blank if not specified)
#   DM_SUSPENDED - suspended state of DM device (0 or 1)
