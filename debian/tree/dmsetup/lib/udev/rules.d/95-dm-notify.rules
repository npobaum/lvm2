# Udev rules for device-mapper devices.
#
# These rules are responsible for sending a notification to a process
# waiting for completion of udev rules. The process is identified by
# a cookie value sent within "change" and "remove" events (the cookie
# value is set before by that process for every action requested).
# Also, it sets default permissions for DM devices if not set already.
