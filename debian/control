Conflicts: lvm-common
Replaces: lvm-common
Description: The Linux Logical Volume Manager
 This is LVM2, the rewrite of The Linux Logical Volume Manager.  LVM
 supports enterprise level volume management of disk and disk subsystems
 by grouping arbitrary disks into volume groups. The total capacity of
 volume groups can be allocated to logical volumes, which are accessed as
 regular block devices.

Package: lvm2-udeb
XC-Package-Type: udeb

Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: The Linux Logical Volume Manager
 This is a udeb, or a microdeb, for the debian-installer.

Package: clvm
Priority: extra
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, lvm2 (= ${binary:Version}), lsb-base, cman
Description: Cluster LVM Daemon for lvm2
 This package provides the clustering interface for lvm2, when used with 
 Red Hat's "cman" cluster infrastructure. It allows logical volumes to
 be created on shared storage devices (eg Fibre Channel, or iSCSI). 

Package: libdevmapper-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, libdevmapper1.02.1 (= ${binary:Version}), libselinux1-dev
Description: The Linux Kernel Device Mapper header files
 The Linux Kernel Device Mapper is the LVM (Linux Logical Volume Management)
 Team's implementation of a minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles
 volume management, while keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout
 in user-space.  This makes it useful for not only LVM, but EVMS, software
 raid, and other drivers that create "virtual" block devices.
 .
 This package contains the (user-space) header files for accessing the
 device-mapper; it allow usage of the device-mapper through a clean,
 consistent interface (as opposed to through kernel ioctls).
